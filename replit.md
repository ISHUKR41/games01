```

## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration
The application uses Supabase for backend services. Required environment variables (with fallback values in code):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`: Supabase anon/public key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: Supabase project ID
- `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin login email
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin login password

Note: The application has hardcoded fallback values in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` for development.

### Workflow
- **Server**: Runs `npm run dev` on port 5000
  - Vite development server with HMR
  - Configured to accept all hosts (required for Replit proxy)
  - Frontend accessible via webview

### Database Setup
The project includes complete Supabase migrations in `supabase/migrations/`:
1. Initial schema (tournaments, registrations, participants tables)
2. Security policies (RLS)
3. RPC functions (registration, slot tracking, status updates)
4. Storage setup (payment screenshots bucket)

Follow `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for a comprehensive, all-in-one database setup SQL script.

## Tournament Configuration

### BGMI Tournaments
- **Solo**: 100 players, ₹20 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹250 runner-up, ₹9/kill
- **Duo**: 50 teams, ₹40 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹250 runner-up, ₹9/kill
- **Squad**: 25 teams, ₹80 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹250 runner-up, ₹9/kill

### Free Fire Tournaments
- **Solo**: 48 players, ₹20 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹150 runner-up, ₹5/kill
- **Duo**: 24 teams, ₹40 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹150 runner-up, ₹5/kill
- **Squad**: 12 teams, ₹80 entry, ₹350 winner, ₹150 runner-up, ₹5/kill

## Admin Features
- Login: `/admin/login`
- Dashboard: `/admin/dashboard`
- View and manage all registrations
- Approve/reject with reasons
- Real-time statistics
- CSV export functionality

## Replit-Specific Configuration

### Port Configuration
- Frontend: Port 5000 (only port exposed to users)
- Vite configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:5000`
- HMR configured for proper hot reload

### Host Verification
The Vite server is configured to accept all hosts (`host: '0.0.0.0'`) which is **required** for Replit's proxy/iframe setup to work properly.

## Current Status

### ✅ Frontend - Fully Working:
- Website loads successfully on Replit with modern UI
- Frontend displays with dark theme and professional gaming imagery
- All 18 stock images loading correctly from public folder
- YouTube videos embedded and playing
- Scroll animations (AOS) working on all pages
- Confetti effects on homepage
- All navigation links working
- Responsive design active across all devices
- Typing sounds feature ready (sound file missing)
- Supabase connection established with fallback credentials
- Optimized refetching prevents page reloads (60s staleTime)
- Tournament IDs standardized across all forms

### 🔴 Backend - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE SETUP:
**CRITICAL: Your Supabase database is completely empty!**

All errors you're experiencing are because the database hasn't been set up:
- ❌ "Tournament Full" error → No tournament records in database
- ❌ "Invalid API Key" on admin login → No user_roles table exists
- ❌ Data disappears on refresh → No database to persist data
- ❌ Slots showing full → Fallback logic when database queries fail

### 🚀 SOLUTION - Run These Scripts:

1. **Run `SUPABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Creates all 5 tables (tournaments, registrations, participants, admin_actions, user_roles)
   - Seeds 6 tournaments with correct IDs
   - Sets up RPC functions
   - Enables realtime subscriptions
   - Creates storage bucket

2. **Follow `ADMIN_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**
   - Create admin user
   - Grant admin role
   - Test login

3. **Read `HOW_TO_FIX_YOUR_ISSUES.md`**
   - Complete troubleshooting guide
   - Step-by-step fixes
   - Verification queries

⏱️ **Setup Time**: ~10 minutes total

## Known Issues & Notes
- **Data Persistence**: Currently using fallback static data. Database setup required for real persistence.
- **WebSocket Errors**: Authentication errors expected until database is initialized.
- **Admin Panel**: Requires database setup + admin user creation to function.
- **Payment Upload**: Requires Supabase storage bucket configuration.
- **Slot Tracking**: Will work across users/refreshes once database is set up.

## Database Setup
**IMPORTANT**: Follow `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for a comprehensive, all-in-one SQL script that:
1. Creates all database tables with proper relationships and constraints
2. Seeds 6 tournament configurations (3 BGMI + 3 Free Fire)
3. Enables Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. Creates 4 RPC functions (register, get_slots, update_status, get_stats)
5. Sets up storage bucket for payment screenshots
6. Enables realtime subscriptions

**One Script Does Everything!** Just copy-paste the complete SQL from the guide into Supabase SQL Editor and run it. The app will work with limited functionality until database is configured.

### Tournament IDs
The frontend uses these standardized tournament IDs:
- BGMI Solo: `bgmi-solo-id`
- BGMI Duo: `bgmi-duo-id`
- BGMI Squad: `bgmi-squad-id`
- Free Fire Solo: `freefire-solo-id`
- Free Fire Duo: `freefire-duo-id`
- Free Fire Squad: `freefire-squad-id`

If your database uses different UUIDs, update these IDs in all 6 form components.

## Deployment
For production deployment to Vercel or other platforms:
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Set environment variables in hosting platform
3. Configure Supabase redirect URLs
4. Deploy `dist` folder

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
