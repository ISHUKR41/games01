## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration
The application uses Supabase for backend services. Required environment variables (configured in Replit Secrets):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous/public key (find in Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: Supabase project ID (optional)
- `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin login email
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin login password

Note: The application has hardcoded fallback values in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` for development. These are configured in Replit Secrets.

### Workflow
- **Server**: Runs `npm run dev` on port 5000
  - Vite development server with HMR
  - Configured to accept all hosts (required for Replit proxy)
  - Frontend accessible via webview

### Database Setup
The project includes complete Supabase migrations in `supabase/migrations/`:
1. Initial schema (tournaments, registrations, participants tables)
2. Security policies (RLS)
3. RPC functions (registration, slot tracking, status updates)
4. Storage setup (payment screenshots bucket)

Follow `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for a comprehensive, all-in-one database setup SQL script.

## Tournament Configuration

### BGMI Tournaments
- **Solo**: 100 players, ‚Çπ20 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ250 runner-up, ‚Çπ9/kill
- **Duo**: 50 teams, ‚Çπ40 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ250 runner-up, ‚Çπ9/kill
- **Squad**: 25 teams, ‚Çπ80 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ250 runner-up, ‚Çπ9/kill

### Free Fire Tournaments
- **Solo**: 48 players, ‚Çπ20 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ150 runner-up, ‚Çπ5/kill
- **Duo**: 24 teams, ‚Çπ40 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ150 runner-up, ‚Çπ5/kill
- **Squad**: 12 teams, ‚Çπ80 entry, ‚Çπ350 winner, ‚Çπ150 runner-up, ‚Çπ5/kill

## Admin Features
- Login: `/admin/login`
- Dashboard: `/admin/dashboard`
- View and manage all registrations
- Approve/reject with reasons
- Real-time statistics
- CSV export functionality

## Replit-Specific Configuration

### Port Configuration
- Frontend: Port 5000 (only port exposed to users)
- Vite configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:5000`
- HMR configured for proper hot reload

### Host Verification
The Vite server is configured to accept all hosts (`host: '0.0.0.0'`) which is **required** for Replit's proxy/iframe setup to work properly.

## Recent Changes
- **Oct 30, 2025 (Late Night)**: üî• CRITICAL FIX - Tournament ID Mismatch Resolved!
  - **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Frontend used string IDs ('bgmi-solo-id') but database generated random UUIDs ‚Üí IDs never matched
  - **COMPLETE SOLUTION**: Implemented deterministic UUIDs that match exactly between frontend and database
  - **New Tournament UUIDs**:
    - BGMI Solo: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`
    - BGMI Duo: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002`
    - BGMI Squad: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003`
    - Free Fire Solo: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`
    - Free Fire Duo: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002`
    - Free Fire Squad: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003`
  - **Files Updated** (16 files total):
    - ‚úÖ Both SQL setup files (COMPLETE_SETUP.sql + SUPABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql)
    - ‚úÖ All 6 registration forms (BGMI & Free Fire: Solo/Duo/Squad)
    - ‚úÖ HomePage.tsx, BGMIPage.tsx, FreeFirePage.tsx

- **Oct 30, 2025 (Night)**: FIXED "Tournament Full" Error + Setup Guides
  - **FIXED**: "Tournament Full" false positive error - was showing even with 0 registrations

  - **SOLUTION**: Updated all 6 forms to check `isLoading` state before determining if full

- **Oct 30, 2025**: Major enhancements and critical fixes
  - Fixed Supabase connection by adding hardcoded credential fallbacks in client.ts
  - Fixed auto-reload issue by reducing refetch frequency (60s staleTime) and disabling aggressive polling
  - Fixed "Tournament Full" false positive by standardizing tournament IDs across all 6 forms
  - Fixed critical image path issue by moving all stock images to public/attached_assets folder
  - Enhanced entire website with modern design elements:

  - Added VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY to Replit Secrets

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Frontend - Fully Working:
- Website loads successfully on Replit with modern UI
- Frontend displays with dark theme and professional gaming imagery
- All 18 stock images loading correctly from public folder
- YouTube videos embedded and playing
- Scroll animations (AOS) working on all pages
- Confetti effects on homepage
- All navigation links working
- Responsive design active across all devices
- Typing sounds feature ready (sound file missing)
- Supabase connection established with fallback credentials
- Optimized refetching prevents page reloads (60s staleTime)
- Tournament IDs standardized across all forms

### üî¥ Backend - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE SETUP:
**CRITICAL: Your Supabase database is completely empty!**

All errors you're experiencing are because the database hasn't been set up:
- ‚ùå "Tournament Full" error ‚Üí No tournament records in database
- ‚ùå "Invalid API Key" on admin login ‚Üí No user_roles table exists
- ‚ùå Data disappears on refresh ‚Üí No database to persist data
- ‚ùå Slots showing full ‚Üí Fallback logic when database queries fail

### üöÄ SOLUTION - Run These Scripts:

1. **Run `SUPABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Creates all 5 tables (tournaments, registrations, participants, admin_actions, user_roles)
   - Seeds 6 tournaments with correct IDs
   - Sets up RPC functions
   - Enables realtime subscriptions
   - Creates storage bucket

2. **Follow `ADMIN_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**
   - Create admin user
   - Grant admin role
   - Test login

3. **Read `HOW_TO_FIX_YOUR_ISSUES.md`**
   - Complete troubleshooting guide
   - Step-by-step fixes
   - Verification queries

‚è±Ô∏è **Setup Time**: ~10 minutes total

## Known Issues & Notes
- **Data Persistence**: Currently using fallback static data. Database setup required for real persistence.
- **WebSocket Errors**: Authentication errors expected until database is initialized.
- **Admin Panel**: Requires database setup + admin user creation to function.
- **Payment Upload**: Requires Supabase storage bucket configuration.
- **Slot Tracking**: Will work across users/refreshes once database is set up.

## Database Setup
**IMPORTANT**: Follow `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for a comprehensive, all-in-one SQL script that:
1. Creates all database tables with proper relationships and constraints
2. Seeds 6 tournament configurations (3 BGMI + 3 Free Fire)
3. Enables Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. Creates 4 RPC functions (register, get_slots, update_status, get_stats)
5. Sets up storage bucket for payment screenshots
6. Enables realtime subscriptions

**One Script Does Everything!** Just copy-paste the complete SQL from the guide into Supabase SQL Editor and run it. The app will work with limited functionality until database is configured.

### Tournament IDs (CRITICAL - Must Match Exactly!)
The frontend and database now use these **specific UUIDs** for tournaments:

**BGMI Tournaments** (Pattern: 10000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx):
- BGMI Solo: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`
- BGMI Duo: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002`
- BGMI Squad: `10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003`

**Free Fire Tournaments** (Pattern: 20000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx):
- Free Fire Solo: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`
- Free Fire Duo: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002`
- Free Fire Squad: `20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003`

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT CHANGE THESE IDs** - They are hardcoded in both frontend and database setup scripts.
These UUIDs are deterministic and will be the same every time you run COMPLETE_SETUP.sql.
