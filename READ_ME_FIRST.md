## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONE IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO DO

Your website won't show real-time slot updates until you run one SQL command in your Supabase dashboard.

### How to Enable Real-Time Updates:

1. **Open Supabase**: Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ielwxcdoejxahmdsfznj/sql

2. **Copy this SQL** and paste it in the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Enable realtime for all tables
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE registrations;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE admin_actions;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE participants;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE tournaments;

-- Set replica identity
ALTER TABLE registrations REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE admin_actions REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE participants REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE tournaments REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON registrations TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON admin_actions TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON participants TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON tournaments TO anon, authenticated;
```

3. **Click "Run"**

4. **Refresh your website**

That's it! After this, your website will show live slot updates in real-time!

## üéØ What Works Now

- ‚úÖ All 6 registration forms (BGMI Solo/Duo/Squad + Free Fire Solo/Duo/Squad)
- ‚úÖ Forms reset automatically after submission
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks or console errors
- ‚úÖ Typing sounds with automatic fallback
- ‚úÖ Modern UI with professional libraries
- ‚úÖ BGMI and Free Fire data are completely separated
- ‚úÖ Better page loading and stability
