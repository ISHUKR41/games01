# GameArena - Complete Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Your GameArena tournament website has been completely modernized with cutting-edge UI, animations, and features!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Environment Variables Setup

The website needs Supabase API credentials to work properly. **You must obtain your own Supabase credentials.**

### Step 1: Create Your Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Click "New Project" and fill in the details:
   - **Project Name**: GameArena (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Select the closest region to your users
3. Wait for the project to be created (takes 1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Credentials

Once your project is created:

1. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Click on **API** in the left menu
3. You'll see your credentials:
   - **Project URL** - Copy this value
   - **anon public** key - Copy this value (under "Project API keys")
   - **Project Reference ID** - Found in the URL or General Settings

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

You have 2 options to configure your credentials:

#### Option A: Replit Secrets (Recommended for Replit)

1. Click on "Tools" ‚Üí "Secrets" in the Replit sidebar
2. Add these secrets (click "New secret" for each):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID = YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL = YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL_HERE
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = YOUR_SECURE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HERE
```

**Replace the placeholders:**
- `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE` ‚Üí Your actual Supabase Project URL (from Step 2)
- `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE` ‚Üí Your actual anon public key (from Step 2)
- `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE` ‚Üí Your project reference ID (from Step 2)
- `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL_HERE` ‚Üí Your email for admin login
- `YOUR_SECURE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HERE` ‚Üí A secure password for admin access

3. After adding all secrets, stop and restart the Server workflow
4. The website should now work!

#### Option B: Direct .env File

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist
2. Add the following variables with your actual values:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL_HERE
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YOUR_SECURE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HERE
```

3. Run: `npm run dev` to restart the server
4. If still not working, try clearing Vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`

## üìä Supabase Database Setup

**IMPORTANT:** To enable data persistence and real-time updates, you must run the SQL setup:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql`
2. Open the file in this project: `supabase/COMPLETE_SETUP.sql`
3. Copy the entire SQL content
4. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

This will create all tables, enable realtime, set up storage, and seed the 6 tournaments.

Detailed instructions are in: `SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## üîí Security Notes

- **NEVER commit your `.env` file to version control** (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- **NEVER share your Supabase credentials publicly**
- **Use Replit Secrets** for production deployments
- **Rotate your keys** if they are ever exposed
- Your anon key is safe to use in frontend code (it's designed for client-side use)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect your data even with the anon key
